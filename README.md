# [vilhelm][]'s "sysrepo"

[vilhelm]: https://github.com/vilhelmb681

This is my `~/.sysrepo`, here is where i keep all of my important system configurations (/etc files, .xmonad, etc) in version control. Management of these are done by setting git's `core.worktree` to `$HOME`, i also set this to `/` in my "root" branch in order to manage my rootfs configs.
